# Memory Card Project

### Purpose
Practice React, functional components / hooks

### Link

NOTE: each card represents a different color, which was 
simple and fast to implement. I admit this makes 
the game too easy and this is not a good choice, however
i think I still achieved the main purpose of the exercise.
